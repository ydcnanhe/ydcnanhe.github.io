We have published a [github repo](https://github.com/ydcnanhe/Imbalanced-Data-Clustering-using-Equilibrium-K-Means/tree/main/python) of Equilibrium K-Means (EKM) and its Mini-Batch variant for clustering highly imbalanced datasets. The paper has been accepted in [IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems](https://cis.ieee.org/publications/t-fuzzy-systems) (IF: 11.9). :sparkles: :smile: :smile:
