### Bio

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I reveived a BSc degree (2017) in Applied Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and received a PhD degree (2022) in Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics (IEDA) from HKUST.

### Research interests

Audio signal processing, including but not limited to separation (also known as the cocktail party problem), denoising, localization, recognition;   

Statistical signal processing, especially involving sparsity pursuing, compressive sensing, and sparse representation;

Fuzzy clustering, especially for unequal size classes (imbalanced data)
